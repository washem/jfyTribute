                    <blockquote>
                    <p>"His Majesty the KING has been graciously pleased to approve of the award of the Victoria Cross to:–</p>
        
                    <p>No. 177239 Pte. John Francis Young, 87th Bn., Quebec R.</p>
        
                    <p>For most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty in attack at Dury-Arras sector on the 2nd September, 1918, when acting as a stretcher-bearer attached to "D" Company of the 87th Bn., Quebec Regiment.</p>
        
                    <p>This company in the advance over the ridge suffered heavy casualties from shell and machine-gun fire.</p>
        
                    <p>Pte. Young, in spite of the complete absence of cover, without the least hesitation went out, and in the open fire-swept ground dressed the wounded. Having exhausted his stock of dressings, on more than one occasion he returned, under intense fire, to his company headquarters for a further supply. This work he continued for over an hour, displaying throughout the most absolute fearlessness.</p>
        
                    <p>To his courageous conduct must be ascribed the saving of the lives of many of his comrades.</p>
        
                    <p>Later, when the fire had somewhat slackened, he organised and led stretcher parties to bring in the wounded whom he had dressed.</p>
        
                    <p>All through the operations of 2nd, 3rd, and 4th September Pte. Young continued to show the greatest valour and devotion to duty."</p>
